## Lesson & Resources

The main objective of this lesson is to learn basic web design, we're using [Bootstrap] for simplicity atm but as spoken during class please do not just use it... Understand it.

For simplicity we downloaded the [Bootstrap]'s bundle CSS and JS files, added them in our project's folders and load them in our HTML as local files. We also did this for [jQuery] (you'll know why in class 002).
